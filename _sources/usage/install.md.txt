## Installation

### PyPI Package

GenRL is compatible with Python 3.6 or later and also depends on `pytorch` and `openai-gym`. The easiest way to install GenRL is with pip, Python's preferred package installer.

    $ pip install genrl

Note that GenRL is an active project and routinely publishes new releases. In order to upgrade GenRL to the latest version, use pip as follows.

    $ pip install -U genrl

### From Source

If you intend to install the latest unreleased version of the library (i.e from source), you can simply do:

    $ git clone https://github.com/SforAiDl/genrl.git
    $ cd genrl
    $ python setup.py install
